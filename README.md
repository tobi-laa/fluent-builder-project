# reflective-fluent-builders
Provides classes for generating fluent builders for existing classes via reflection. This might be useful in cases
where it is not possible to change the sources of said classes to generate builders directly.

The artifact for the corresponding maven plugin is `reflective-fluent-builders-maven-plugin`.

*Work in progress - first release tbd.*
